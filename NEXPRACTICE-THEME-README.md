# NexPractice Blue Theme Implementation

This document outlines the blue theme implementation that has been applied to the NexPractice section of the NexAcademy application to ensure visual consistency with the rest of the app.

## Theme Colors

The blue theme for NexPractice is based on a primary blue color palette, matching the design aesthetic from the sign-in page and the rest of the NexAcademy app.

### Key Color Values

```
Primary Blue: #3b82f6 (Blue-500)
Secondary Blue: #dbeafe (Blue-100)
Accent Blue: #eff6ff (Blue-50)
Dark Blue: #1e40af (Blue-800)
```

## Components Updated

The following NexPractice components have been updated to follow the blue theme:

1. **Badge Component**: Updated all badge variants to use blue colors for backgrounds, text, and borders.
2. **Button Component**: Created a dedicated NexPractice button component with multiple blue-themed variants.
3. **Card Component**: Implemented cards with blue accents, gradients and headers.

## Theme Configuration

A central theme configuration file (`components/nexpractice/theme-config.tsx`) provides:

- Consistent color definitions
- Card styles
- Button variants
- Typography styles
- Badge variants
- Status indicators

## Design Principles

1. **Consistency**: Components match the blue theme established in the sign-in page
2. **Clarity**: Blue theme provides clear visual hierarchy and focus
3. **Appropriate Contrast**: Text and interactive elements maintain proper contrast ratios for accessibility
4. **Visual Interest**: Gradients and subtle variations of blue add visual depth without overwhelming

## Usage Guidelines

When developing new features for NexPractice:

1. Import components from the dedicated NexPractice UI folder 
   ```tsx
   import { Button } from "@/components/nexpractice/ui/button"
   ```

2. For direct Tailwind CSS styling, import the theme configuration
   ```tsx
   import { colors } from "@/components/nexpractice/theme-config"
   ```

3. Use the provided variant props for components to select appropriate styling
   ```tsx
   <Button variant="gradient">Blue Gradient Button</Button>
   <Card variant="accent">Blue Accent Card</Card>
   ```

4. Follow the established pattern of using blue as the primary color theme, with other colors as accents only when necessary for specific status indicators or visual hierarchy
