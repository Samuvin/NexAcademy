# NexAcademy Blue Theme Implementation

This document outlines the blue theme implementation that has been applied consistently throughout the NexAcademy application.

## Theme Colors

The blue theme is based on a primary blue color (HSL: 204, 100%, 50%) and uses various shades and tints for different UI elements. The color palette has been defined using CSS variables in `globals.css`.

### CSS Variables

The key color variables are:

```css
--primary: 204 100% 50%;        /* Main blue */
--secondary: 204 70% 95%;       /* Light blue for secondary elements */
--accent: 204 100% 97%;         /* Very light blue for accent elements */
--border: 204 60% 90%;          /* Blue-tinted borders */
--ring: 204 100% 50%;           /* Focus rings */
```

Dark mode variants of these colors are also provided.

### Chart Colors

For data visualization, a series of blue-based colors have been added:

```css
--chart-1: 204 100% 50%;
--chart-2: 210 100% 60%;
--chart-3: 217 100% 50%;
--chart-4: 224 100% 60%;
--chart-5: 230 100% 50%;
```

## Components Updated

The following components have been updated to use the blue theme:

1. **Button Component**: All button variants now use the blue theme consistently.
2. **Sidebar Component**: The sidebar has been updated with blue gradients and hover states.
3. **Top Bar Component**: Progress indicators and other elements now use blue.
4. **Badge Component**: Badge variants now follow the blue theme.
5. **Resizable Panels**: Resize handles now use blue for hover and active states.

## Gradient Usage

Gradients have been standardized to use blue variants:

- Primary gradient: `from-blue-500 to-blue-600`
- Premium gradient: `from-blue-600 to-indigo-600`

## Best Practices for Future Development

When extending the UI:

1. Use the defined CSS variables whenever possible (`bg-primary`, `text-primary`, etc.)
2. For gradients, stick to blue shades like `from-blue-500 to-blue-600`
3. For hover effects, use `hover:bg-primary/90` or `hover:bg-blue-50`
4. For borders, use `border-blue-100/30` in light mode and `border-blue-900/20` in dark mode
5. For text, use `text-blue-600` in light mode and `text-blue-400` in dark mode

By following these guidelines, we'll maintain a consistent blue theme throughout the application, providing a cohesive user experience that matches the sign-in page design.
