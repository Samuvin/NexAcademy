# GraphQL Submissions API Implementation

This document summarizes the implementation of the GraphQL API for problem submissions in the NexAcademy platform.

## Overview

We converted the REST API for problem submissions (`/api/submissions`) into a GraphQL API using Apollo Server and GraphQL Yoga. This implementation provides better flexibility, type safety, and integration with the existing GraphQL infrastructure.

## Implementation Details

### 1. GraphQL Schema

Created a new schema file in `app/api/graphql/schemas/submissionSchema.ts` that defines:
- `ProblemSubmission` type with all submission fields
- `User` type for author information
- `SubmissionsResponse` type for paginated results
- `problemSubmissions` query with filtering and pagination parameters

### 2. GraphQL Resolver

Implemented a resolver in `app/api/graphql/resolvers/submissionResolvers.ts` that:
- Validates user authentication
- Checks permissions (users can only view their own submissions unless they're admins)
- Retrieves submissions from the database with pagination
- Returns submissions with proper status mappings (ACCEPTED or FAILED)

### 3. Client Service

Added a submission service in `lib/services/submissionService.ts` that:
- Defines the GraphQL query for submissions
- Provides a function to fetch submissions with proper error handling
- Handles network errors and GraphQL errors gracefully

### 4. Client Integration

Updated the ProblemClientPage component to:
- Use the new GraphQL service instead of direct fetch calls
- Handle proper error states
- Provide detailed logging for debugging
- Fix ID handling to ensure compatibility with API requirements

## Troubleshooting

We encountered and fixed several issues:

1. **Authentication**: 
   - GraphQL queries require authentication via Next-Auth sessions
   - Created a testing script that checks submissions directly in the database
   - Added browser console code for testing GraphQL queries while authenticated

2. **ID Format**: 
   - Ensured we use the correct ID field from the coding question object
   - Added fallback to ensure backward compatibility with different formats

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Added detailed error handling in both client and server code
   - Fixed type issues with error objects in TypeScript
   - Added comprehensive logging for debugging

4. **Testing Data**:
   - Created scripts to check for existing submissions
   - Implemented a script to add test submissions for debugging
   - Added a direct database query tool for validation

## Testing

To test the GraphQL API for submissions:

1. Use the browser console:
```javascript
fetch('/api/graphql', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    query: `
      query {
        problemSubmissions(
          problemId: "YOUR_PROBLEM_ID"
          page: 1
          pageSize: 10
        ) {
          submissions { id, language, status }
          total
          totalPages
        }
      }
    `
  })
})
.then(res => res.json())
.then(data => console.log('GraphQL Response:', data));
```

2. Use the scripts in the `scripts` directory:
   - `check-submissions.js`: Check existing submissions in the database
   - `create-test-submission.js`: Add test submissions
   - `test-graphql-query-with-auth.js`: Test GraphQL with direct DB access
